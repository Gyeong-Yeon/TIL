# 1. Let's start the interview. Tell me something about yourself.

Hi, my name is GyeongYeon. I'm in my late 20s and I live in Gumi.
I graduated from university with a Material Engineering degree 3 years ago. And I'm taking some Software developing corses now, I want to develop websites or mobile applications. Also, I believe that people's life is highly correlated with Software.
I like making new friends and meeting new people. Some people say that it's not easy to make the first move, but I have no problem with it.
Also, I feel so comfortable and secure talking and listening to my friends. Since I have many friends, I get a lot of useful information from them about jobs, which is helpful for my future. Therefore, I am sure I will have good relationships with people wherever I work.
It's challenging to find a job that you enjoy, and people in my town choose their jobs based on the salary they receive. However, I would rather enjoy my life with less money than have a lot of money with no life at all. I might change my mind. But until then, I want to be myself.

# 2. 주거

- [x] 개인 주택이나 아파트에 홀로 거주

```
# 1. 좋아하는 방 : I would like to know where you live. Describe your house in detail. What does it look like? How many rooms do you have? Which is your favorite room at home?

I live by myself in a Villa Two Room. Its downtown location makes it easy for me to take public transportation.
My favorite room is my bedroom. It's a great place to get some rest and have fun in my free time. Even though my room is small, it has everything I need, including a comfortable and cozy bed to sleep on. When I'm on my bed, I listen to music with Bluetooth speakers and play with my smart phone.
Also, I have a TV with a wide screen that is perfect for watching movies. I usually spend my weekend in bed watching vintage American dramas, such as Friends.
For these reasons, I like my bedroom the most.

# 2. 집에서 주로 하는 일 : Tell me about the things that you do at home. What are some daily routines you engage in? What is special about each activity? Give me all the details.

I like to keep my place nice and clean, so I try to clean my house as often as I can and these are my daily routines at home.
When I start cleaning my house, I open all the windows. Next, I vaccum and mop the floors. I have a washing machine in my villa, so it doesn't take a long time to finish the laundry.
However, it's hard to take out the garbage and recycling. These were not my job when I lived with my family, so I'm still learning. I take out the food waste everyday and gather recyclable items in the separate recycling basket.
Even though it's not easy doing all the housework by myself, I feel very refreshed and clean after it's done.

# 3. 집에서 일어나는 문제 : Tell me about the problems you have experienced at home. What were those problems? How did they occur? How did you deal with those problems?

My villa is pretty new, so I haven't had any major problems yet.
However, I saw a poster in my stairs that some people are throwing cigarettes from their villas onto the street. This could cause serious problems if they hit someone walking on the road. People could suffer minor or major burns. They could even start a fire.
Therefore, the manager will fine anyone who throws cigarettes from their villa, and people who report the unit number will reveive a reward.
I hope the new policy is working out very well, so nobody gets hurt.
