# 1. Let's start the interview. Tell me something about yourself.

Hi, my name is GyeongYeon. I'm in my late 20s and I live in Gumi.
Nowadays, I'm taking some Software courses, because I want to develop websites or mobile applications. Also, I believe that people's life is highly correlated with Software.
I like making new friends and meeting new people. Some people say that it's not easy to make the first move, but I have no problem with it. Since I have many friends, I get a lot of useful information from them about jobs, which is helpful for my future. Therefore, I am sure I will have good relationships with people wherever I work.
It's challenging to find a job that you enjoy, and people in my town choose their jobs based on the salary they receive. However, I would rather enjoy my life with less money. I might change my mind. But until then, I want to be myself.

# 2. 주거

- [x] 개인 주택이나 아파트에 홀로 거주

```
# 1. 좋아하는 방 : I would like to know where you live. Describe your house in detail. What does it look like? How many rooms do you have? Which is your favorite room at home?

I live by myself in a Villa Two Room. Its downtown location makes it easy for me to take public transportation.
My favorite room is my bedroom. It's a great place to get some rest and have fun in my free time. Even though my room is small, it has everything I need, including a comfortable and cozy bed to sleep on. When I'm on my bed, I listen to music with Bluetooth speakers and play with my smart phone.
Also, I have a TV with a wide screen that is perfect for watching movies. I usually spend my weekend in bed watching vintage American dramas, such as Friends.
For these reasons, I like my bedroom the most.
```

```
# 2. 집에서 주로 하는 일 : Tell me about the things that you do at home. What are some daily routines you engage in? What is special about each activity? Give me all the details.
 
I like to keep my place nice and clean, so I try to clean my house as often as I can and these are my daily routines at home.
When I start cleaning my house, I open all the windows. Next, I vaccum and mop the floors. I have a washing machine in my villa, so it doesn't take a long time to finish the laundry.
However, it's hard to take out the garbage and recycling. These were not my job when I lived with my family, so I'm still learning. I take out the food waste everyday and gather recyclable items in the separate recycling basket.
Even though it's not easy doing all the housework by myself, I feel very refreshed and clean after it's done.
```

```
# 3. 집에서 일어나는 문제 : Tell me about the problems you have experienced at home. What were those problems? How did they occur? How did you deal with those problems?

My villa is pretty new, so I haven't had any major problems yet.
However, I saw a poster in my stairs that some people are throwing cigarettes from their villas onto the street. This could cause serious problems if they hit someone walking on the road. People could suffer minor or major burns. They could even start a fire.
Therefore, the manager will fine anyone who throws cigarettes from their villa, and people who report the unit number will receive a reward.
I hope the new policy is working out very well, so nobody gets hurt.
```

```
# 4. 집/주거지 변화 : Houses have changed over the years. How is the structure of the houses different from the past?

Houses have changed over the years according to people's lifestyles.
In the past, houses were usually big and had small balconies. Also, they were often built for large families.
However, houses for smaller families have become more popular these days. The size of the house is decreasing, and people are focusing on interior designs. There are more apartments in the city containing a lot of units in one building.
I'm not sure about the differences in materials build houses though, because I've never thought about it honestly. I guess the materials become cheaper, more durable, and more energy efficient. Also, the new technology has made construction easier.
However, one thing has remained constant from the past to the present: the house is still an important place to rest and come together for family.
```

```
# 5. 집 렌트 문제점 : Talk about the problems people have when they rent a house or an apartment. Why do those problems occur and how do people solve those problems?

There are many problems associated with renting an apartment or house in the city.
I know there are a lot of empty houses outside the city, but it's very difficult to find a place in a downtown location.
Everyone wants to live in the center of the city to make their commute easier.
Also, it can be safer for people/women because there are a lot of people walking at night in downtown areas. Therefore, the demand for rentals leads to a shortage of housing.
If I was lucky enough to find a place downtown, the rent would be too high for me to afford.
Therefore, young people usually find rommates to share the rent. In this way, they save money and don't get lonely.

- [x] 공연 보기
- [x] 콘서트 보기.

# 1. 좋아하는 영화 장르 : What is your favorite genre of movies? Why do you like those movies?

My favorite movie type is the romantic comedy. I enjoy these films because they are easy to watch with anyone and I don't really have to think.
I especially enjoy 90's romantic comedies, such as Notting Hill, While You Were Sleeping, and Sleepless in Seattle. I know it sounds conry, but I love the 90's settings.
My favorite film is Notting Hill. I particularly love the stars of the movie; they played their roles perfectly. And I must mention the background soundtrack; I think everyone knows the song She. It has been sung by various singers, but the original version in the movie is the best. I also love the setting of the movie and the movie shows beautiful places in London as well.
All in all, I think romantic comedies are easy to watch with anyone and usually have great music. That's it!

# 2. 최근에 간 영화관 묘사, 영화 보기 전후에 한 일 : Tell me about the movie theater you went to revently. What did you do before and after the movie?

I went a multiplex theater in downtown last year to see the "TENET". There are different kinds of multiplex theater in Korea, such as CGV, MegaBox, and Lotte Cinema, and they are usually found in busy towns.
The one I went to was Megabox. I really like going to Megabox because it's always very clean and it has great facilities. They have 3D, 4D, and IMAX theaters there. Plus, I can get discounts once a month.
There were a lot of stores near the theater, so I did some shopping with my friends before going to the movie and had dinner after the movie. The theater is in the centre of downtown, so it was easy for us to find shops and restaurant.
As usual, it was a great experience.

# 3. 가장 기억에 남는 영화, 줄거리, 특징 : What was the most memorable movie you watched in the past? What was it about? What was so special about that movie? Would you recommend that movie to other people?

```
# 4. 최근 뉴스에 언급된 영화배우, 뉴스에서 들은 내용 : Tell me about one of the actors who was in the news because of some issue recently. What was the issue about? How did the news affect your impression of that actor?

To be honest, I don't usually watch the news about the movies or actors, so I don't know any specific news. What I can think of right now, though, is that there are many Korean actors gaining good reputations in the world.
The famous Korean actor, Byunghun Lee, starred in the Hollywood movie 'Magnificent 7' 5 years ago, and it is not even his first Hollywood movie. Lee acted in the G.I.Joe series, as well.
I had not previously been interested in him, but after hearing that news, I wondered about his performance in the movie, which caused me to watch his movies in a row.
I think he is really into the characters he plays and experesses each character very well in his own unique way. Maybe that's why a lot of people trust his acting ability and like him.
Whenever I hear news about Korean actors in Hollywood movies, I am very proud of them and impressed with their efforts.

- [x] 음악 감상하기

```
# 1. 좋아하는 음악 장르, 가수 : You indicated that you like to listen to music. What type of music do you like listening to? Who is your favorite singer?

I like all kinds of music, but I mostly listen to Hiphop these days.
My favorite singer is SUGA, and I just love his new album. He's a member of a famous Korean idol group, BTS, and he released his solo album last year.
I like his voice and the new songs on his album. His voice is very easy to listen to, and it goes well with most kinds of songs.
I also have another favorite female singer, Cardi B. She is the most famous female singer in the world.
I like the way she sings because she expresses her emotions so well through the lyrics and the music. She usually writes her own songs, which is awesome.
Both SUGA and Cardi B are still young, and I can't wait to see music they'll give us in the future. Someday I'd love to go to their concerts and listen their songs live.
```

```
# 2. 어렸을 때 들었던 음악, 취향의 변화 : How did you first get interested in music? What kind of music did you listen to when you were young? How was that music different from the music you listen to today? How has your interest in music changed over the years?

My older brother love to collect music CDs when I was young, so I was automatically exposed to all different kinds of music at home.
I used to listen to Hiphop songs, like Dynamicduo, and Jinusean because my brother loved Hiphop music. Later, I found great singers like Bigbang and BTS, and I was instantly addicted to their music.
But as I get older, I am stating to listen to different kinds of music depending on what I am doing. When I am studying or going to sleep, I try to listen soft, quite music without lyrics, instrumental music. On the other hand, when I feel blue or sad I prefer listening to some kind of upbeat music.
So as I get older, I am starting to enjoy more different kinds of music.

# 3. 라이브 음악을 들었던 경험, 공연에 갔었던 경험 : Tell me about a time when you went to listen to some live music. Perhaps it was at a concert or a live cafe. What was the mood like, and how did you like the music you listened to there?

```
# 4. 음악을 언제, 어디서, 왜 듣는지 : When and where do you like to listen to music? Why do listen to music?

I like to listen to music when I am going somewhere, and it is pretty easy because I listen to music on my smartphone, and I carry it with me all the time.
I can listen to music wherever I am; on the street, on a bus, even in the subway. Anywhere at all.
I have been doing it since I was young, and I get bored without music when I am moving around. However, I prefer not to listen to music when I am driving because I am not a good driver yet, and I find music distracting.
Also, if I need to study in a noisy place, I usually plug in my earphones to listen to music because it helps me to focus better.
Overall, I listen to music whenever I am on the move and wherever I am.
```

# 5. 좋아하는 음악 or 가수, 작곡가 2명 비교 : Pick two different types of music or composers you like. What is special about each type of music? What are some similarities and differences between two?

```
# 6. 최근 화제가 되는 음악 기기/장비 : Talk about some music gadgets or equipment that people are currently interested in. How are they useful and what do people like about them?

People in Korea listen to music with their smartphones because it means they do not have to carry another device with them.
People usually download an app or listen to songs online using a streaming service. It is easy to search for the songs they like online and the sound quality is good and clear.
Personally, I really like the fact that I can see the lyrics while I am listening to music.
Smartphones have a Bluetooth function that can connect to other devices. My parents love this because they can connect to their car audios.
Smartphones make it easier to listen to music wherever you are.

But when I am busy with my work and study, I run on the treadmill. I normally listen to music and run for 40 minutes.
Afterwards, my body feels lighter, and I am less nervous, which are good for both my mental and physical health.

# 2. 조깅을 시작하게 된 계기 : How did you first become interested in jogging? Why did you start jogging? What has been changed since you started jogging? Tell me everything in detail.

Well, I first started (swimming/cycling/jogging/running/hiking) because I was worried about my health. I had to go to the emergency room because of my irregular life style. I didn't eat anything until late at night and wasn't getting enough sleep or having sufficient breaks.
As a result, I ended up experiencing chronic pain in my stomach. My family doctor recommended regular eating and exercise to help me to release my stress, because the reason why I wasn't eating was down to stress.
Therefore, I decided to walk and run more to imporve my health. At first, it was a hassle to go out. However, it soon became one of my routines.
I am still busy with my studies or work, but I still try to workout at least two or three times a week. It helps me to release my stress and sleep better. I also feel refreshed after a long run. I suppose that's how I started (swimming/cycling/jogging/running/hiking).

My favorite place to visit in (Korea/abroad) is (Jeju/Hawaii Island) where you will not only see the locals, but also many foreign tourists. The main reasons why I like to go there are the great food and beautiful scenery.
I find it difficult to choose what to eat because each area in (Jeju/Hawaii Island) has its own specialities. Personally, I really like the seaside and this is a fantastic place to enjoy it. Wihen I have been there in the past, I have benefited from the fresh air and enjoyed the clear water.
I hope that I can visit again with my family this summer because it only takes a few hours by plane. Well, that's why Jeju Island is my favorite place in (Korea/abroad).

# 5. 여행 과거-현재 비교 또는 어려워진 점 : How is travelling today different from the past? What are some difficulties people go through regarding trips? Has travelling become more difficult in any why? If so, tell me why.

People have fewer difficulties going on trips as compared to the past.
We have various transportation options and they have developed for the better over the years.
For example, if I want to go to a different city in Korea, I can take a KTX train instead of an airplane. KTX is much faster than the train we used to take, and it goes everywhere in Korea. Therefore, I usually use KTX If I take a domestic trip.
Plus, smartphones make our trips much easier than in the past. People do not need to carry maps while they're travelling because their smartphones become their GPS. Also, we can easily book tickets and hotels with smartphones, and find popular places to visit everywhere.
For these reasons, travelling has become easier than in the past.

# 6. 여행과 관련하여 사람들이 갖고 있는 우려 : What are some issues or concerns people have related to travelling? What do people do to address those issues or concerns?

As soon as I heard this question, all I could think about was safety issues.
People can have accidents when they take any kind of transportation, including buses, cars, and airplanes.
When they travel, people need to take precautions. Before people play near water during the summer or hike mountains during the winter, they need to check whether it's safe or not.
I know it's a very unfortunate situation, but travellers can also be robbed. They can lose all the money they have and even their passport as well. When people go abroad, they especially need to be careful, with being pick-pockted.
These are all the issues or concerns I can think of regarding travel.
